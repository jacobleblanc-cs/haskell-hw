# haskell-hw
A collection of some Haskell programs I wrote for my programming languages course. Not complete as I failed to save all my files during the semester. Includes demonstrations of functional programming techniques, recursion, data type definitions, etc.

These programs were written during the Fall semester of 2024. I am uploading them now for preservation and to build my portfolio.

Note that I do not condone cheating, so if you are currently in a Haskell or programming languages course you should not refer to this resource. Find another reference, I am not responsible for any dishonest use of this repository.
